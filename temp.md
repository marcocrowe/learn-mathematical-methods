Sure, let's first find the equation of line $M$ using the given points $a(3, 8)$ and $b(-3, 4)$.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### 1. Finding the distance between points $a$ and $b$:
The distance $d$ between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

Substituting the coordinates of $a$ and $b$:
$d = \sqrt{(-3 - 3)^2 + (4 - 8)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{(-6)^2 + (-4)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{36 + 16}$
$d = \sqrt{52}$
$d = 2\sqrt{13}$

So, the distance between $a$ and $b$ is $2\sqrt{13}$.

#### 2. Finding the equation of line $M$:
First, find the slope $m$ of the line passing through $a(3, 8)$ and $b(-3, 4)$:
$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{4 - 8}{-3 - 3} = \frac{-4}{-6} = \frac{2}{3}$

Using the point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ and point $a(3, 8)$:
$y - 8 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 3)$
$y - 8 = \frac{2}{3}x - 2$
$y = \frac{2}{3}x + 6$

Thus, the equation of line $M$ is:
$y = \frac{2}{3}x + 6$

#### 3. Writing an equation for any line parallel to $M$:
Lines that are parallel have the same slope. Since the slope of line $M$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, the equation of any line parallel to $M$ will have the form:
$y = \frac{2}{3}x + c$

Where $c$ is any real number. For example, if $c = 1$, the equation of a parallel line could be:
$y = \frac{2}{3}x + 1$

#### 4. Writing an equation for any line perpendicular to $M$:
Lines that are perpendicular have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other. The slope of $M$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, so the slope of a line perpendicular to $M$ is:
$-\frac{3}{2}$

The equation of any line with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$ will have the form:
$y = -\frac{3}{2}x + c$

Where $c$ is any real number. For example, if $c = 4$, the equation of a perpendicular line could be:
$y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 4$

#### 5. Finding the coordinates of the point of intersection of lines $M$ and $N$:
Line $N$ has the equation $5x + 2y = 12$.

We already have the equation of line $M$:
$y = \frac{2}{3}x + 6$

Substitute $y$ from the equation of line $M$ into the equation of line $N$:
$5x + 2\left(\frac{2}{3}x + 6\right) = 12$
$5x + \frac{4}{3}x + 12 = 12$
$5x + \frac{4}{3}x = 0$
$\frac{15}{3}x + \frac{4}{3}x = 0$
$\frac{19}{3}x = 0$
$x = 0$

Substitute $x = 0$ back into the equation of line $M$:
$y = \frac{2}{3}(0) + 6$
$y = 6$

Thus, the coordinates of the point of intersection of $M$ and $N$ are $(0, 6)$.

### Summary:
- Parallel line to $M$: $y = \frac{2}{3}x + 1$
- Perpendicular line to $M$: $y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 4$
- Point of intersection of $M$ and $N$: $(0, 6)$
