# Differentiation Rules

Differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus, used to find the rate at which a function is changing at any point. Here are some key rules and techniques for differentiating functions:

1. **Power Rule**:  
   - For a function $f(x) = x^n$, the derivative is $f'(x) = n x^{n-1}$.

2. **Constant Rule**:  
   - The derivative of a constant $c$ is $0$.  
   - If $f(x) = c$, then $f'(x) = 0$.

3. **Constant Multiple Rule**:  
   - For a function $f(x) = c \cdot g(x)$, where $c$ is a constant, the derivative is $f'(x) = c \cdot g'(x)$.

4. **Sum Rule**:  
   - For functions $f(x) = g(x) + h(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x)$.

5. **Difference Rule**:  
   - For functions $f(x) = g(x) - h(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = g'(x) - h'(x)$.

6. **Product Rule**:  
   - For functions $f(x) = g(x) \cdot h(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = g'(x) \cdot h(x) + g(x) \cdot h'(x)$.

7. **Quotient Rule**:  
   - For functions $f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$, the derivative is  
     $$f'(x) = \frac{g'(x) \cdot h(x) - g(x) \cdot h'(x)}{[h(x)]^2}$$

8. **Chain Rule**:  
   - For a composite function $f(x) = g(h(x))$, the derivative is  
     $$f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \cdot h'(x)$$

9. **Derivative of Exponential Functions**:  
   - For $f(x) = e^x$, the derivative is $f'(x) = e^x$.
   - For $f(x) = a^x$, where $a$ is a constant, the derivative is $f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)$.

10. **Derivative of Logarithmic Functions**:  
    - For $f(x) = \ln(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.
    - For $f(x) = \log_a(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x \ln(a)}$.

11. **Derivative of Trigonometric Functions**:
    - For $f(x) = \sin(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \cos(x)$.
    - For $f(x) = \cos(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = -\sin(x)$.
    - For $f(x) = \tan(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \sec^2(x)$.
    - For $f(x) = \cot(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = -\csc^2(x)$.
    - For $f(x) = \sec(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \sec(x) \cdot \tan(x)$.
    - For $f(x) = \csc(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = -\csc(x) \cdot \cot(x)$.

12. **Derivative of Inverse Trigonometric Functions**:
    - For $f(x) = \arcsin(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$.
    - For $f(x) = \arccos(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$.
    - For $f(x) = \arctan(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}$.
    - For $f(x) = arccot(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = -\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$.
    - For $f(x) = arcsec(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}$.
    - For $f(x) = arccsc(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x) = -\frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}$.

These rules help simplify the process of finding derivatives and are essential tools for solving calculus problems.
